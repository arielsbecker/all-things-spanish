# all-things-spanish
Just an index for the milestones on [this project](https://go.nebulas.io/project/96) in Go Nebulas ([as it was discussed in the community forum before](https://community.nebulas.io/d/135-all-things-spanish)).

## Index

## Observations

There are just a few images I left untranslated, as I don't have the originals to edit, and doing it over the png's will result in a poor result, so I'll edit them once I have access to the editables (svg, ai, or any other format).

The PDF compilations for the LaTeX articles can include their references in English as I was unable to implement Babel in them without breaking it. I'm using texlive, and I noticed Nebulas Team is using xelatex, so I'll leave the source code as it is, so they can merge the code and use xelatex to compile the PDF. In any case, I can provide a rendered PDF using a conversion to texlive format in a separate repo or folder if needed.
